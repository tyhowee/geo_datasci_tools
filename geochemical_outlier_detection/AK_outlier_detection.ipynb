This method compares the distribution of angles of distance vectors between a sample point and its neighbors; a point with a large distribution of vector angles is considered an inlier (within a cluster), while a point with a smaller distribution of angles is likely an outlier (outside a cluster). An angle-based score is then calculated, with less variation indicating a higher probability of the sample point being an outlier. One benefit of ABOD is that it is free of any parameters, and thus does not have the potential prediction variability resulting from tuning. Its implementation does not, however, output a binary classification, thus in order to generate one an arbitrary threshold must be defined. "
