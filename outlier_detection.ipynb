    "# <u>Multivariate Outlier Detection in Geochemical Datasets</u>\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is intended as an open-source resource for exploring, analyzing and comparing three different methods of outlier detection in geochemical datasets in the context of mineral exploration.  \n",
    "<br />\n",
    "<br />\n",
    "The three primary outlier detection algorithms we will use are the following: \n",
    "- Isolation Forests (IF) (Liu et al., 2008)\n",
    "- Local Outlier Factor (LOF) (Breunig et al., 2000)\n",
    "- Angle Based Outlier Detection (ABOD) (Shahrestani & Sanislav, 2025)\n",
    "<br />\n",
    "<br />\n",
    "\n",
    "This work is driven from the findings in Antoine Cat√©'s article on multivariate outlier detection for mineral exploration.\n",
